Rubycoin
========

A peer-to-peer digital currency, issued and managed without any central authority.
There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Rubycoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corruption.

With Rubycoin, you can be your own bank on a decentralized network. Each user with a balance plays an important role in keeping the network fast, secure, and energy-efficient. Interest is automatically earned by every user that participates.
